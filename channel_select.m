% A function which selects the best N channels of A for the least-squared 
% problem min_{x} 1/2 * ||Ax - b ||Â² which best estimates b.
%
% Required Inputs:
%   A - Data/measurements used in estimation where P is the number of 
%       channels (including delayed versions) and T is the number of
%       time samples. 
%       If A consists of delayed samples of a channel, all delays of 
%       a channel are expected to be consecutive columns
%       Size: (T X P)
%   b - The desired data to be estimated using A. Size: (T X 1)
%   N - Number of channels to be selected.
% Optional Inputs:
%   'method' - A string for the method to be used to select best N channels
%            Currently supported:
%            'utility' - Utility based channel reduction. Here, if A is 
%            singular, utility definition with minimum norm increase 
%            interpretation is used.
%            (ref. A. Bertrand, 2018)
%
%   'lags' - Number of delays (in number of samples) already applied to channels/columns of A.
%          Channel-k and its time-lagged copies are together considered as a group. The utility of this group 
%          is considered as the utility of channel-k.
%          For. eg:
%          If every channel and their 2 time-lagged versions (a channel itself + 2 lagged versions) are present, then:
%          lags = 2.
%          (note: group size in the above case would be 3.)
%          default: 0 (no time-lagged versions included. group size is 1)
%   
%               
%   
%
% Outputs: 
%   ch_selected - The indices of the best N channels in A. They are 
%                 ordered in descending order of significance.
